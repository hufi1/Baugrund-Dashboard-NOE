# Baugrundpreise-NOE
an analysis on the Lower Austria's Communities and their family friendliness compared to the price per sqm

I want to visualize the following data with the help of Python (Pandas) and PowerBi.  
The data should consist of the median price per square meter of land per town/city and should also show how family-friendly the town is. 
To do so, I downloaded the following Data:
•	Price per square meter for Lower Austrian disctricts from here:

•	Data on Kindergarten-Facilities in Lower Austria:
